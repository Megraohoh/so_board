## PROPOSAL
### So Board
For the game players who like to keep track of new board and card games they've experienced. The games posted can be designated as 'favorite'. Players can also 'favorite' one another, viewable only on a personal profile. 
 

So Board is a social network for board game and card game players. 

### NOTES
- Once I began at NSS I got to experience a renewed interest in table top games. I wanted to be able to remember what game I'd played and who I'd met across the table. 
- I see this as an app that can grow to be an aid in organizing events and family gatherings.
